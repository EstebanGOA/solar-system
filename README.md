# Solar system project
## Project deliverable for 3D Graphics Programming subject
### Overview
This project aims to create a 3D representation of a solar system using C++ programming language and GLFW library to access the OpenGL API.

### Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure the following prerequisites are met: 
- C++ compiler
- GLFW library installed
- OpenGL API availabe

### Features
During the course we learn about diferent techiques that were applied into this project. 
- Meshes & Uniforms
- Transformations
- Projections
- Camera
- Textures, Z-Test
- Lighting
- Normal Matrix
- Blending
- Multitextures
